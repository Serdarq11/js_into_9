source code -> console.log("hello world");
node.js -> is the Runtime environment ( where execution happens)
output -> hello world

Intellij IDEA: This mostly for Java and Kotlin

These code editors are known as IDE ( ıntegrated Development Environment)

compiler: checks if the source code has any syntax error
execution: running the code

Statement: Each line of code.
Convention: Each statement is followed by a semi-colon (;). Unwritten rules but good to follow.
