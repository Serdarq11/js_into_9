Computer: 
A computer is an electronic machine that is used to input, process, and then output data,
typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program.
Computer is consist of software and hardware
    Software: Operating systems (windows, MAC), Microsoft Office Suite, Paint, application
    Hardware: Mouse, screen, printer, hard-disk, CPU

||||||||||||  -> oldest way of number system 
0123456789    -> base-10 number system   



Binary code: ones and zeros
- Known as base-2 number system 
1= ON 
2= OFF 

-It is the machine language that computer understands.
-All the letters, digits, shapes and more are converted to binary code to be understood 
and processed by computer.

Binary Units:
Bit: one or zero
byte: 8 bits
kilobyte: 1024 bytes





MAC: cmd -> command
windows: CTRL -> control

Programming language: A programming language is a vocabulary and set of 
gramatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.
- You can create apps 
- communication with the machine
- has rules 
- Examples: Java SCript, Java, Go, Python, C#

interpreted languages: javaScript
compiled languages: lack ambiguity - confusion - conflict


compilation - compile - compiler -> checking if your code is gramatically correct
execution - execute - executor   -> running the code 


1. Language runtime environment - Node.js 
2.The best IDE to write and execute the code - VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse IDE, Sublime, Atom 

IDE: Integrated Development Environment  

Syntax Rules: You MUST follow.
Conventions: Not MUST but followed by almost all the programmer. Good to follow.
